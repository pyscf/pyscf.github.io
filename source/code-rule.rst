Code standard
*************

* Code at least should work under python-2.7, gcc-4.8.

* 90/10 functional/OOP, unless performance critical, functions are pure.

* 90/10 Python/C, only computational hot spots were written in C.

* To extend python function with C/Fortran:

  - Following C89 (gnu89) standard for C code.  (complex? variable length array?)
    http://flash-gordon.me.uk/ansi.c.txt

  - Following Fortran 95 standard for Fortran code.
    http://j3-fortran.org/doc/standing/archive/007/97-007r2/pdf/97-007r2.pdf

  - Do **not** use other program languages (to keep the package light-weight).

* Conservative on advanced language feature.

* Minimal dependence principle

  - Minimal requirements on 3rd party program or libraries.

  - Loose-coupling between modules so that the failure of one module can
    have minimal effects on the other modules.

* Not enforced but recommended

  - Compatible with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9;

  - Following C89 (gnu89) standard for C code;

  - Using ctypes to bridge C/python functions


Name convention
---------------

* The prefix or suffix underscore in the function names have special meanings

  - functions with prefix-underscore like ``_fn`` are private functions.
    They are typically not documented, and not recommended to use.

  - functions with suffix-underscore like ``fn_`` means that they have side
    effects.  The side effects include the change of the input argument,
    the runtime modification of the class definitions (attributes or
    members), or module definitions (global variables or functions) etc.

  - regular (pure) functions do not have underscore as the prefix or suffix.

API convention
--------------

* :class:`gto.Mole` holds all global parameters, like the log level, the
  max memory usage etc.  They are used as the default value for all
  other classes.

* Method class.

  - Most QC method classes (like HF, CASSCF, FCI, ...) directly take
    three attributes ``verbose``, ``stdout`` and ``max_memory`` from
    :class:`gto.Mole`.  Overwriting them only affects the behavior of the
    local instance for that method class.  In the following example,
    ``mf.verbose`` mutes the noises produced by :class:`RHF`
    method, and the output of :class:`MP2` is written in the log file
    ``example.log``::

    >>> from pyscf import gto, scf, mp
    >>> mol = gto.M(atom='H 0 0 0; H 0 0 1', verbose=5)
    >>> mf = scf.RHF(mol)
    >>> mf.verbose = 0
    >>> mf.kernel()
    >>> mp2 = mp.MP2(mf)
    >>> mp2.stdout = open('example.log', 'w')
    >>> mp2.kernel()

  - Method class are only to hold the options or environments (like
    convergence threshold, max iterations, ...) to control the
    behavior/convergence of the method.  The intermediate status are
    **not** supposed to be saved in the method class (during the
    computation).  However, the final results or solutions are kept in
    the method object for convenience.  Once the results are stored in
    the particular method class, they are assumed to be read only, since
    many class member functions take them as the default arguments if the
    caller didn't provide enough parameters.

  - In __init__ function, initialize/define the problem size.  The
    problem size parameters (like num_orbitals etc) can be considered as
    environments.  They are not supposed to be changed by other functions.

  - Kernel functions
    Although the method classes have various entrance/main function, many
    of them provide an entrance function called ``kernel``.  You can
    simply call the ``kernel`` function and it will guide the program
    flow to the right main function.

  - Default value of class methods' arguments.  Many class methods
    can take the results of the calculations which were held in the class as the
    default arguments.

* Function arguments

  - First argument is handler.  The handler is one of :class:`gto.Mole`
    object, a mean-field object, or a post-Hartree-Fock object.

..  - When any of the three parmeters ``mo_energy``, ``mo_coeff`` and
      ``mo_occ`` are appeared in the argument lists,  they are always put
      in this order: ``mo_energy, mo_coeff, mo_occ``.

  - xxx_slice
    Taking the elements of object xxx between xxx_slice = (start, end)
    (start <= elem < end)
