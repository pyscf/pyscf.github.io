icmpspt --- Internal-contracted MPS perturbation method
*******************************************************

ic-MPSPT is an interface to a multi-reference perturbation method that uses DMRG (MPS) wavefunctions as the zeroth order wavefunction.  The DMRG wavefunction needs to be generated using the :mod:`dmrgscf` solver. The ic-MPSPT solver can be obtained from Sandeep Sharma (sanshar@gmail.com).
