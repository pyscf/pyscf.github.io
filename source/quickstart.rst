Quickstart
**********

This quickstart provides a brief introduction to the use of PySCF in common quantum chemical simulations. These make reference to specific examples within the dedicated `examples <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/tree/master/examples>`_ directory. For brevity, and so as to not repeat a number of function calls, please note that the cells below often share objects in-between one another. The selection below is far from exhaustive: additional details on the various modules are presented in the accompanying user guide and within the examples directory.

.. _INPUT:

Input Parsing
=============

Molecules (or unit cells, cf. the :ref:`periodic <PBC>` section) can be created using the convenient shortcut function ``Mole.build()`` as in (`gto/00-input_mole.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/gto/00-input_mole.py>`_):

  >>> mol_h2o = gto.M(atom = 'O 0 0 0; H 0 1 0; H 0 0 1', basis = 'ccpvdz')

Whenever you change the value of the attributes of :class:`Mole`, you'll need to call ``build()`` again to refresh the internal data of the object.

Symmetry may be specified in the ``Mole.symmetry`` attribute as either ``True`` or ``False`` (default is ``False``, i.e., off). Alternatively, a particular subgroup can be specified by a string argument (`gto/13-symmetry.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/gto/13-symmetry.py>`_):

  >>> mol_c2 = gto.M(atom = 'C 0 0 .625; C 0 0 -.625', symmetry = 'd2h')
  
There are many other ways to input a molecular or crystalline geometry (e.g., by means of Z-matrices or reading in .xyz files), cf. the complete suite of `gto <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/gto>`_ and `pbc <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc>`_ examples.

.. _MF:

Mean-Field Theory
=================

.. _HF:

Hartree-Fock
------------

A mean-field (e.g., Hartree-Fock) calculation on the H\ :sub:`2`\ O geometry of the :ref:`above <INPUT>` section can be performed by (cf. `scf/00-simple_hf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/00-simple_hf.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import scf
  >>> rhf_h2o = scf.RHF(mol_h2o)
  >>> e_h2o = rhf_h2o.kernel()

Besides the final converged ground-state energy, the mean-field object stores the accompanying MO coefficients, occupations, etc. To illustrate how open-shell, possibly spin-polarized calculations are performed, different Hartree-Fock simulations of the O\ :sub:`2` dimer - with its triplet ground state - can be setup as (cf. `scf/02-rohf_uhf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/02-rohf_uhf.py>`_):

  >>> mol_o2 = gto.M(atom='O 0 0 0; O 0 0 1.2', spin=2) # (n+2 alpha, n beta) electrons
  >>> uhf_o2 = scf.UHF(mol_o2)
  >>> uhf_o2.kernel()
  >>> rohf_o2 = scf.ROHF(mol_o2)
  >>> rohf_o2.kernel()

Finally, a second-order, Newton-Raphson SCF method is available, (which is also compatible with most but not all XC functionals, cf. :ref:`below <KSDFT>`). This requires a set of orthonormal orbitals and their corresponding occupancies as initial guesses. These are automatically generated if none are provided (cf. `scf/22-newton.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/22-newton.py>`_):

  >>> rhf_h2o = rhf_h2o.newton()
  >>> e_h2o = rhf_h2o.kernel()

.. _KSDFT:

Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
-----------------------------------

Running a KS-DFT calculation is as straightforward as the :ref:`above <HF>` HF counterpart (cf. `dft/00-simple_dft.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/dft/00-simple_dft.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import dft
  >>> rks_h2o = dft.RKS(mol) # likewise for UKS and ROKS
  >>> rks_h2o.xc = 'b3lyp'
  
Besides the use of predefined XC functionals (cf. `pyscf/dft/libxc.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/dft/libxc.py>`_ and `pyscf/dft/xcfun.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/dft/xcfun.py>`_ for the complete lists of
available functionals), these can also be fully defined by the user (`dft/24-custom_xc_functional.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/dft/24-custom_xc_functional.py>`_), as can the angular and radial grids used in the calculation (`dft/11-grid_scheme.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/dft/11-grid_scheme.py>`_):

  >>> rks_h2o.xc = '.2 * HF + .08 * LDA + .72 * B88, .81 * LYP + .19 * VWN' # B3LYP
  >>> rks_h2o.grids.atom_grid = (100, 770)
  >>> rks_h2o.grids.prune = None
  >>> e_rks = rks_h2o.kernel()
  
Combining dense and sparse grids is important whenever XC functionals with non-local dispersion (van der Waals) corrections are employed (cf. `dft/33-nlc_functionals.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/dft/33-nlc_functionals.py>`_):

  >>> rks_c2 = dft.RKS(mol_c2)
  >>> rks_c2.xc = 'wb97m_v'
  >>> rks_c2.nlc = 'vv10'
  >>> rks_c2.grids.atom_grid = (99,590)
  >>> rks_c2.grids.prune = None
  >>> rks_c2.nlcgrids.atom_grid = (50,194)
  >>> rks_c2.nlcgrids.prune = dft.gen_grid.sg1_prune

.. _TDMF:

Time-Dependent Mean-Field Theory
--------------------------------

Linear response theory is available for both HF and KS-DFT (cf. `tddft/00-simple_tddft.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/tddft/00-simple_tddft.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import tdscf
  >>> tdhf_h2o = tdscf.TDHF(rhf_h2o)
  >>> tdhf_h2o.nstates = 6
  >>> tdhf_h2o.kernel()
  >>> tddft_h2o = tdscf.TDA(rks_h2o) # TDDFT with Tamm-Dancoff approximation
  >>> tddft_h2o.nstates = 4
  >>> tddft_h2o.kernel()

From a converged time-dependent mean-field calculation, the corresponding natural transition orbitals for a particular excited state may be recovered as (cf. `tddft/01-nto_analysis.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/tddft/01-nto_analysis.py>`_):

  >>> weights, nto = tdhf_h2o.get_nto(state=2)
  
As an alternative to response theory, :math:`\Delta`-SCF with Gill's maximum overlap method is available to converge specific excited states, cf. `scf/50-mom-deltaSCF.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/50-mom-deltaSCF.py>`_.

.. _LOC:

Spatially Localized Molecular Orbitals
--------------------------------------

PySCF offers a number of different standard schemes for localizing MOs, e.g., Pipek-Mezey, Foster-Boys, and Edmiston-Ruedenberg (cf. `local_orb/03-split_localization.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/local_orb/03-split_localization.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import lo
  >>> occ_orbs = rhf_h2o.mo_coeff[:, rhf_h2o.mo_occ > 0.]
  >>> fb_h2o = lo.Boys(mol_h2o, occ_orbs, rhf_h2o) # Foster-Boys
  >>> loc_occ_orbs = fb.kernel()
  >>> virt_orbs = rhf_h2o.mo_coeff[:, rhf_h2o.mo_occ == 0.]
  >>> pm_h2o = lo.PM(mol_h2o, virt_orbs, rhf_h2o) # Pipek-Mezey
  >>> loc_virt_orbs = pm.kernel()
  
Knizia's intrinsic bond orbitals can be computed as (cf. `local_orb/04-ibo_benzene_cubegen.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/local_orb/04-ibo_benzene_cubegen.py>`_):

  >>> iao = lo.iao.iao(mol, occ_orbs)
  >>> iao = lo.vec_lowdin(iao, rhf_h2o.get_ovlp())
  >>> ibo = lo.ibo.ibo(mol, occ_orbs, iaos=iao)

.. _REL:

Relativistic Effects
--------------------

PySCF implements a Dirac-Hartree-Fock solver for relativistic effects. Different Hamiltonians are available, for example with Breit and/or Gaunt interactions (cf. `scf/05-breit_gaunt.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/05-breit_gaunt.py>`_):

  >>> dhf_c2 = scf.DHF(mol_c2)
  >>> dhf_c2.with_gaunt = True
  >>> dhf_c2.with_breit = True
  >>> dhf_c2.kernel()

At lower cost, scalar relativistic effects can be included in a mean-field treatment by decorating the a :class:`SCF` object (either HF or KS-DFT) with the ``.x2c()`` method (cf. `scf/21-x2c.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/21-x2c.py>`_). This modifies the Hamiltonian and affects subsequent correlated calculations:

  >>> uks_o2_x2c = scf.UKS(mol_o2).x2c()
  >>> uks_o2_x2c.kernel()

.. _SYM:

Symmetry Handling
-----------------

Wave function symmetry may be explicitly controlled in an SCF calculation. For example, in the C\ :sub:`2` calculation of the :ref:`above <INPUT>` section, one can specify a given orbital occupancy through the ``SCF.irrep_nelec`` attribute (`scf/13-symmetry.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/13-symmetry.py>`_):

  >>> rhf_c2 = scf.RHF(mol_c2)
  >>> rhf_c2.irrep_nelec = {'Ag': 4, 'B1u': 4, 'B2u': 2, 'B3u': 2}
  >>> e_c2 = rhf_c2.kernel()
  
Likewise, orbital symmetries may deduced from the MO coefficients (`symm/32-symmetrize_natural_orbital <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/symm/32-symmetrize_natural_orbital.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import symm
  >>> orbsym = symm.label_orb_symm(mol_c2, mol_c2.irrep_id, mol_c2.symm_orb, rhf_c2.mo_coeff)

Integrals & Density Fitting
===========================

.. _INT:

1- and 2-Electron Integrals
---------------------------

A common use of PySCF is to obtain 1- and 2-electron integrals within a chosen MO basis. The latter are stored by default as (ij|kl) with 4-fold symmetry (cf. also `ao2mo/00-mo_integrals.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/ao2mo/00-mo_integrals.py>`_):

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from pyscf import ao2mo
  >>> hcore_ao = mol_h2o.intor_symmetric('int1e_kin') + mol_h2o.intor_symmetric('int1e_nuc')
  >>> hcore_mo = np.einsum('pi,pq,qj->ij', rhf_h2o.mo_coeff, hcore_ao, rhf_h2o.mo_coeff)
  >>> eri_4fold_ao = mol_h2o.intor('int2e_sph', aosym=4)
  >>> eri_4fold_mo = ao2mo.incore.full(eri_4fold_ao, rhf_h2o.mo_coeff)
  
The transformed 2-electron integrals may be saved to and read from a file in HDF5 format (`ao2mo/01-outcore.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/ao2mo/01-outcore.py>`_):

  >>> import tempfile
  >>> import h5py
  >>> ftmp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
  >>> ao2mo.kernel(mol_h2o, rhf_h2o.mo_coeff, ftmp.name)
  >>> with h5py.File(ftmp.name) as f:
  >>>     eri_4fold = f['eri_mo']
  
User-defined Hamiltonians can be used in PySCF, e.g., as input to a mean-field calculation and subsequent correlated treatments (`mcscf/40-customizing_hamiltonian.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/40-customizing_hamiltonian.py>`_):

  >>> # 1D anti-PBC Hubbard model at half filling
  >>> n, u = 12, 2.
  >>> mol_hub = gto.M()
  >>> mol_hub.nelectron = n // 2
  >>> mol_hub.incore_anyway = True
  >>> h1 = np.zeros([n] * 2, dtype=np.float64)
  >>> for i in range(n-1):
  >>>     h1[i, i+1] = h1[i+1, i] = -1.
  >>> h1[n-1, 0] = h1[0, n-1] = -1.
  >>> eri = np.zeros([n] * 4, dtype=np.float64)
  >>> for i in range(n):
  >>>     eri[i, i, i, i] = u
  >>> rhf_hub = scf.RHF(mol_hub)
  >>> rhf_hub.get_hcore = lambda *args: h1
  >>> rhf_hub.get_ovlp = lambda *args: np.eye(n)
  >>> rhf_hub._eri = ao2mo.restore(8, eri, n) # 8-fold symmetry
  >>> rhf_hub.init_guess = '1e'
  >>> rhf_hub.kernel()

.. _DF:

Density Fitting Techniques
--------------------------

Density fitting of 2-electron integrals is conveniently invoked in either of two ways (cf. `df/00-with_df.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/df/00-with_df.py>`_):

  >>> rhf_c2_df = rhf_c2.density_fit(auxbasis='def2-universal-jfit') # option 1
  >>> from pyscf import df
  >>> rhf_c2_df = df.density_fit(scf.RHF(mol_c2), auxbasis='def2-universal-jfit') # option 2
  
In the former, decoration by the ``scf.density_fit`` function generates a new object that works in exactly the
same way as the regular :class:`SCF` object. 

For an example of how to use density fitting alongside the :ref:`Newton-Raphson SCF algorithm <HF>` and :ref:`scalar relativistic effects <REL>`, please see `scf/23-decorate_scf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/scf/23-decorate_scf.py>`_.

Correlated Wave Function Theory
===============================

.. _MPCCADC:

Perturbation Theory, Coupled Cluster, and Algebraic Diagrammatic Constructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PySCF offers many facilities for correlated calculation. Common used examples include second-order Møller-Plesset, coupled cluster, and algebraic diagrammatic construction approximations. These modules can employ :ref:`density fitting <DF>`, based on the ``SCF.with_df`` attribute of the underlying mean-field object (cf. `mp/00-simple_mp2.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mp/00-simple_mp2.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import mp
  >>> mp2_c2 = mp.MP2(rhf_c2)
  >>> e_c2 = mp2_c2.kernel()[0]
  >>> mp2_c2_df = mp.MP2(rhf_c2_df)
  >>> e_c2_df = mp2_c2_df.kernel()[0]
  
At the coupled cluster level of theory, CCD, CCSD, and CCSD(T) calculation can be performed for both closed- and open-shell systems (cf. `cc/00-simple_ccsd_t.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/cc/00-simple_ccsd_t.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import cc
  >>> ccsd_h2o = cc.CCSD(rhf_h2o)
  >>> ccsd_h2o.direct = True # AO-direct algorithm to reduce I/O overhead
  >>> ccsd_h2o.frozen = 1 # frozen core
  >>> e_ccsd = ccsd_h2o.kernel()[1]
  >>> e_ccsd_t = e_ccsd + ccsd_h2o.ccsd_t()

Starting from a ground-state CCSD calculation, subsequent EOM-CCSD calculations in the spin-flip, IP/EA, and EE channels can be performed (cf. `cc/20-ip_ea_eom_ccsd.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/cc/20-ip_ea_eom_ccsd.py>`_):

  >>> e_ip_ccsd = ccsd_h2o.ipccsd(nroots=1)[0]
  >>> e_ea_ccsd = ccsd_h2o.eaccsd(nroots=1)[0]
  >>> e_ee_ccsd = ccsd_h2o.eeccsd(nroots=1)[0]
  
ADC(2), ADC(2)-X, and ADC(3) schemes have been implemented using a similar API (cf. `adc/01-closed_shell.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/adc/01-closed_shell.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import adc
  >>> adc_h2o = adc.ADC(rhf_h2o)
  >>> e_ip_adc2 = adc_h2o.kernel()[0] # IP-ADC(2) for 1 root
  >>> adc_h2o.method = "adc(2)-x"
  >>> adc_h2o.method_type = "ea"
  >>> e_ea_adc2x = adc_h2o.kernel()[0] # EA-ADC(2)-x for 1 root
  >>> adc_h2o.method = "adc(3)"
  >>> adc_h2o.method_type = "ea"
  >>> e_ea_adc3 = adc_h2o.kernel(nroots = 3)[0] # EA-ADC(3) for 3 roots

.. _FCI:

Full Configuration Interaction
------------------------------

PySCF offers powerful kernels to perform exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians optimized for different possible symmetries. For the simplest case, where all electrons of a given system are correlated among all orbitals, the syntax follows that of other correlation methods for closed- and open-shell systems (cf. `fci/00-simple_fci.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/fci/00-simple_fci.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import fci
  >>> fci_h2o = fci.FCI(rhf_h2o)
  >>> e_fci = fci_h2o.kernel()[0]
  
However, the various FCI solvers (tabulated in `pyscf/fci/__init__.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/fci/__init__.py>`_) support user-defined 1- and 2-electron (``h1e,h2e``) Hamiltonians (cf. `fci/01-given_h1e_h2e.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/fci/01-given_h1e_h2e.py>`_):

  >>> fs = fci.direct_spin1.FCI() # direct_spin0 instead for singlet system ground states
  >>> e, fcivec = fs.kernel(h1e, h2e, N, 8) # 8 electrons in N orbitals
  >>> e, fcivec = fs.kernel(h1e, h2e, N, (5,4))  # (5 alpha, 4 beta) electrons
  >>> e, fcivec = fs.kernel(h1e, h2e, N, (3,1))  # (3 alpha, 1 beta) electrons
  
One can obtain multiple states by setting ``FCI.nroots > 1``, and 1- to 4-electron density matrices, alongside 1- and 2-electron transition density matrices, (cf. `fci/14-density_matrix.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/fci/14-density_matrix.py>`_):

  >>> rdm1 = fs.make_rdm1(fcivec, N, (5, 4)) # spin-traced 1-electron density matrix
  >>> rdm1a, rdm1b = fs.make_rdm1s(fcivec, norb, (5, 4)) # alpha and beta 1-electron density matrices
  >>> t_rdm1 = fs.trans_rdm1(fcivec0, fcivec1, N, (5, 4)) # spin-traced 1-electron transition density matrix
  
In addition, the FCI code is accompanied by a large library of tools to manipulate and inspect wave functions, assign spin states and :ref:`symmetry <SYM>`, etc. 

Multiconfigurational Methods
============================

.. _CAS:

Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction & Self-Consistent Field
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The FCI solvers discussed :ref:`above <FCI>` can be used with complete active space methods in PySCF, all of which share a similar API (cf. `mcscf/00-simple_casci.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/00-simple_casci.py>`_ & `mcscf/00-simple_casscf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/00-simple_casscf.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import mcscf
  >>> casci_h2o = mcscf.CASCI(rhf_h2o, 6, 8)
  >>> e_casci = casci_h2o.kernel()[0]
  >>> casscf_h2o = mcscf.CASSCF(rhf_h2o, 6, 8)
  >>> e_casscf = casscf_h2o.kernel()[0]

The CASCI and CASSCF classes support many variations, such as, :ref:`density fitting of 2-electron integrals <DF>` (cf. `mcscf/16-density_fitting.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/16-density_fitting.py>`_) and the standard frozen-core approximation (cf. `mcscf/19-frozen_core.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/19-frozen_core.py>`_):

  >>> casscf_h2o_df = mcscf.DFCASSCF(rhf_h2o, 6, 8, auxbasis='ccpvtzfit')
  >>> casscf_h2o_df.frozen = 1 # frozen core
  >>> e_casscf_df = casscf_h2o_df.kernel()[0]

In the case of CASSCF calculations, these may be performed in a state-specific or state-averaged manner (cf. `mcscf/41-state_average.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mcscf/41-state_average.py>`_):

  >>> casscf_c2 = mcscf.CASSCF(rhf_c2, 8, 8)
  >>> solver_t = fci.direct_spin1_symm.FCI(mol_c2)
  >>> solver_t.spin = 2
  >>> solver_t.nroots = 1
  >>> solver_t = fci.addons.fix_spin(solver_t, shift=.2, ss=2) # 1 triplet
  >>> solver_s = fci.direct_spin0_symm.FCI(mol_c2) # 2 singlets
  >>> solver_s.spin = 0
  >>> solver_s.nroots = 2
  >>> mcscf.state_average_mix_(casscf_c2, [solver_t, solver_s], np.ones(3) / 3.)
  >>> casscf_c2.kernel()
  
Finally, additional dynamic correlation may be added by means of second-order perturbation theory in the form of NEVPT2 (cf. `mrpt/02-cr2_nevpt2/cr2-scan.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/mrpt/02-cr2_nevpt2/cr2-scan.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import mrpt
  >>> e_nevpt2 = mrpt.NEVPT(casscf_h2o).kernel()

.. _EXTFCI:

External Approximate Full Configuration Interaction Solvers
-----------------------------------------------------------

Besides the exact solvers discussed :ref:`earlier <FCI>`, PySCF has interfaces to efficient approximate solvers. For instance, the `StackBlock <https://github.com/sanshar/StackBlock>`_ or `block2 <https://github.com/block-hczhai/block2-preview>`_ code can be used as a DMRG solver to perform parallel DMRGSCF calculations across several processes (cf. `dmrg/01-dmrg_casscf_with_stackblock.py <https://github.com/pyscf/dmrgscf/blob/master/examples/01-dmrg_casscf_with_stackblock.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import dmrgscf
  >>> import os
  >>> from pyscf.dmrgscf import settings
  >>> if 'SLURMD_NODENAME' in os.environ: # slurm system
  >>>     settings.MPIPREFIX = 'srun'
  >>> elif 'PBS_NODEFILE' in os.environ: # PBS system
  >>>     settings.MPIPREFIX = 'mpirun'
  >>> else: # MPI on single node
  >>>     settings.MPIPREFIX = 'mpirun -np 4'
  >>> dmrgscf_c2 = dmrgscf.DMRGSCF(rhf_c2, 8, 8)
  >>> dmrgscf_c2.state_average_([.5] * 2)
  >>> dmrgscf_c2.fcisolver.memory = 4 # in GB
  >>> dmrgscf_c2.fcisolver.num_thrds = 8 # number of threads to spawn on each MPI process
  >>> e_dmrgscf = dmrgscf_c2.kernel()
  
Similar interfaces to i-FCIQMC (using `NECI <https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE>`_) and SHCI (using either `Dice <https://github.com/sanshar/Dice>`_ or `Arrow <https://github.com/QMC-Cornell/shci>`_) are available. 

.. _GEOMOPT:

Geometry Optimization
=====================

In PySCF, geometry optimizations can be performed using the `geomeTRIC <https://github.com/leeping/geomeTRIC>`_ or `PyBerny <https://github.com/jhrmnn/pyberny>`_ libraries (cf. `geomopt/01-geomeTRIC.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/geomopt/01-geomeTRIC.py>`_ and `geomopt/01-pyberny.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/geomopt/01-pyberny.py>`_, respectively):

  >>> from pyscf.geomopt.geometric_solver import optimize as geometric_opt
  >>> mol_h2o_rhf_eq = geometric_opt(rhf_h2o)
  >>> from pyscf.geomopt.berny_solver import optimize as pyberny_opt
  >>> mol_h2o_casscf_eq = pyberny_opt(casscf_h2o)

For :ref:`multiconfigurational methods <CAS>`, the geometry of an excited state can be optimized in either a state-specific or state-averaged manner (cf. `geomopt/12-mcscf_excited_states.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/geomopt/12-mcscf_excited_states.py>`_):

  >>> casci_h2o.state_specific_(2) # state-specific opt
  >>> casci_grad = casci_h2o.nuc_grad_method().as_scanner()
  >>> mol_h2o_casci_2nd_ex = casci_grad.optimizer().kernel()
  >>> casscf_h2o.state_average_([.25] * 4) # state-averaged opt
  >>> casscf_grad = casscf_h2o.nuc_grad_method().as_scanner()
  >>> mol_h2o_sa_casscf = casscf_grad.optimizer().kernel()

Solvent Effects
===============

.. _PCMCOSMO:

Polarizable Continuum & COSMO Methods
-------------------------------------

PySCF can include solvent effects into most types of calculations, as implemented by either PCM or COSMO (both in their `domain-decomposed formulations <https://www.ddpcm.org/>`_ that yields a fast discretization of the polarization equations). For instance, :ref:`geometry optimizations <GEOMOPT>` can be performed for ground and excited states in the presence of a solvent (cf. `solvent/21-tddft_geomopt.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/solvent/21-tddft_geomopt.py>`_):

  >>> rhf_h2o_pcm = mol_h2o.RHF().ddPCM()
  >>> rhf_h2o_pcm.kernel()
  >>> tdhf_h2o_pcm = rhf_h2o_pcm.TDA().ddPCM()
  >>> tdhf_h2o_pcm.with_solvent.equilibrium_solvation = True
  >>> mol_h2o_tdhf_pcm_2nd_ex = tdhf_h2o_pcm.nuc_grad_method().as_scanner(state=2).optimizer().kernel()
  
Similarly, correlated methods, e.g., CCSD, may be performed in the presence of a solvent with either a relaxed or unrelaxed (mean-field) potential (cf. `solvent/03-ccsd_with_ddcosmo.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/solvent/03-ccsd_with_ddcosmo.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import solvent
  >>> rhf_h2o_cosmo = mol_h2o.RHF().ddCOSMO()
  >>> rhf_h2o_cosmo.kernel()
  >>> ccsd_h2o_cosmo_rel = solvent.ddCOSMO(cc.CCSD(rhf_h2o))
  >>> ccsd_h2o_cosmo_rel.kernel()
  >>> ccsd_h2o_cosmo_unrel = solvent.ddCOSMO(cc.CCSD(rhf_h2o_cosmo), dm=rhf_h2o_cosmo.make_rdm1())
  >>> ccsd_h2o_cosmo_unrel.kernel()
  
Different solvents are chosen by setting the ``SCF.with_solvent.eps`` attribute.

.. _QMMM:

Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Methods
---------------------------------------------

QM/MM calculations can be performed by either of two different methods in PySCF. Standard point charges can be included in most calculations, be these mean-field or correlated. In the latter case, background charges can be conveniently added to the underlying SCF calculation (cf. `qmmm/03-ccsd.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/qmmm/03-ccsd.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf import qmmm
  >>> coords = np.random.random((5, 3)) * 10.
  >>> charges = (np.arange(5.) + 1.) * -.1
  >>> rhf_h2o_qmmm = qmmm.mm_charge(rhf_h2o, coords, charges)
  >>> rhf_h2o_qmmm.kernel()
  >>> ccsd_h2o_qmmm = cc.CCSD(rhf_h2o_qmmm)
  >>> e_ccsd = ccsd_h2o_qmmm.kernel()[1]

Alternatively, a combination of the `PyFraME <https://gitlab.com/FraME-projects/PyFraME>`_ framework and `CPPE <https://github.com/maxscheurer/cppe>`_ library can be used to prepare and run polarizable embedding calculations from within PySCF, cf. `solvent/04-pe_potfile_from_pyframe.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/solvent/04-pe_potfile_from_pyframe.py>`_ and `solvent/04-scf_with_pe.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/solvent/04-scf_with_pe.py>`_.

.. _PBC:

Periodic Boundary Conditions
============================

PySCF provides equal support for molecular and crystalline materials calculations. The latter functionality is found in
the PBC modules.  As discussed above in :ref:`input parsing <INPUT>`, the API to initialize unit cells is almost identical to that for finite-size molecules (cf. `pbc/00-input_cell.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc/00-input_cell.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf.pbc import gto as pbcgto
  >>> cell_diamond = pbcgto.M(atom = '''C     0.      0.      0.
                                        C     .8917    .8917   .8917
                                        C     1.7834  1.7834  0.
                                        C     2.6751  2.6751   .8917
                                        C     1.7834  0.      1.7834
                                        C     2.6751   .8917  2.6751
                                        C     0.      1.7834  1.7834
                                        C     .8917   2.6751  2.6751''',
                              basis = 'gth-szv',
                              pseudo = 'gth-pade',
                              a = np.eye(3) * 3.5668)

Besides the difference in import of the ``gto`` module, the only new attributes are ``Cell.a`` and ``Cell.pseudo``. The former  (``a``) is a matrix of lattice vectors, where each row denotes a primitive vector, while the latter (``pseudo``) is an (optional) crystal pseudo potential (cf. `pyscf/pbc/gto/pseudo/GTH_POTENTIALS <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/pbc/gto/pseudo/GTH_POTENTIALS>`_ for a full list of these). All electron calculations can be performed by omitting ``pseudo``.
Alternatively, molecular effective core potentials can be used by setting the ``Cell.ecp`` attribute, cf. `pbc/05-input_pp.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc/05-input_pp.py>`_.

Generally, crystal calculations use the same or similar APIs to the molecule calculations.  For instance, an all-electron calculation with k-point sampling at the KS-DFT level using :ref:`density fitting <DF>` (recommended) and a :ref:`second-order SCF algorithm <HF>` is specified as (cf. `pbc/21-k_points_all_electron_scf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc/21-k_points_all_electron_scf.py>`_):

 >>> from pyscf.pbc import dft as pbcdft
 >>> kpts = cell_diamond.make_kpts([4] * 3) # 4 k-poins for each axis
 >>> krks_diamond = pbcdft.KRKS(cell_diamond, kpts).density_fit(auxbasis='weigend')
 >>> krks_diamond.xc = 'bp86'
 >>> krks_diamond = krks_diamond.newton()
 >>> krks_diamond.kernel()

After converging the mean-field calculation, dynamic electron correlation can be treated by various methods, e.g. MP2 or (EOM-)CCSD. These calculations can again be performed with k-point sampling (cf. `pbc/22-k_points_ccsd.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc/22-k_points_ccsd.py>`_). At the :math:`\Gamma`-point, all correlation methods available for molecules can be employed (cf. `pbc/12-gamma_point_post_hf.py <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/examples/pbc/12-gamma_point_post_hf.py>`_):

  >>> from pyscf.pbc import scf as pbcscf
  >>> rhf_diamond = pbcscf.RHF(cell_diamond).density_fit()
  >>> rhf_diamond.kernel()
  >>> ccsd_diamond = cc.CCSD(rhf_diamond)
  >>> ccsd_diamond.kernel()
