A more complete Contributor Guide is planned for the future.  In the meantime,
if you are interested in contributing to PySCF, please open an
[Issue](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/issues) on GitHub (including bug
reports, feature requests, and unexpected behaviors) or start a
[Discussion](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/discussions).
