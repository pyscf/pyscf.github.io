Introduction
============

Density fitting (DF), sometimes also called the resolution of identity (RI) approximation, is a method to approximate the four-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) by two- and three-index tensors. :cite:`Dunlap00PCCP` It achieves so by expanding the atomic orbital (AO) pair density in a second, auxiliary Gaussian basis set. PySCF has extensive supports for using DF in both molecular and crystalline calculations. This section of the user document covers the basic usage of DF in molecular applications. See :ref:`user_pbc_df` for the use of DF in periodic calculations.


Using DF in calculations
========================

DF is not used by default when initializing a :class:`SCF` or :class:`MCSCF` object, but can be invoked via the :func:`density_fit` method as follows::

    from pyscf import gto, scf, mcscf
    mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1.2', basis='def2-tzvp')
    mf = scf.RHF(mol).density_fit().run()
    mc = mcscf.CASSCF(mf, 8, 10).density_fit().run()

Alternatively, one can initialize a :class:`DF` object and overwrite the :attr:`with_df` attribute of the :class:`SCF` object::

    from pyscf import gto, scf, df
    mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1.2', basis='def2-tzvp')
    mydf = df.DF(mol).build()
    mf = scf.RHF(mol).density_fit()
    mf.with_df = mydf
    mf.kernel()

Setting :attr:`with_df` to ``None`` turns DF off.

Once the SCF calculations using DF are done, all post-SCF methods will use DF automatically. The example below performs a TDDFT/TDA calculation using DF::

    from pyscf import gto, dft, tddft
    mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1.2', basis='def2-tzvp')
    mf = dft.RKS(mol, xc="b3lyp").density_fit().run()
    td = tddft.TDA(mf).run()
    print(td.e)


.. _choice_of_auxbasis:

Choice of auxiliary basis
=========================

General consideration
---------------------

The choice of auxiliary basis depends on the AO basis.
By default, PySCF uses the pre-defined auxiliary basis set optimized for the AO basis set if the former exists.
This includes many commonly used AO basis sets in electronic structure calculations, e.g., the Ahlrichs' `def2` family, :cite:`Hellweg07TCA,Weigend98CPL` the Dunning's `cc` family, :cite:`Weigend02PCCP` etc.

When pre-defined auxiliary basis set is not available, an even-tempered basis (ETB) set is generated by the following rule

.. math::

    \varphi &= r^l \exp(-\zeta_{il} r^2), \quad i = 0, 1, \cdots, n \\
    \zeta_{il} &= \alpha_l \times \beta^i

where :math:`\alpha_l` and :math:`N` are inferred automatically from the AO basis, and :math:`\beta = 2.0` by default.

The user can overwrite the default choice by setting :attr:`auxbasis` upon initialization or at a later stage::

    from pyscf import gto, scf, df
    mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1.2', basis='cc-pvdz')
    mf = scf.RHF(mol).density_fit(auxbasis="weigend")
    mf.kernel() # -108.910953335055
    mf.with_df.auxbasis = "cc-pvdz-jkfit"   # this is the default
    mf.kernel() # -108.913710743723
    mf.with_df.auxbasis = df.aug_etb(mol, beta=1.7) # ETB with beta = 1.7
    mf.kernel() # -108.914059329528

The user can check what auxiliary basis set is used at any time by::

    print(mf.with_df.auxmol.basis)

More examples on using customized auxiliary basis can be found in :source:`examples/df/01-auxbasis.py`.


Special consideration for DFT
-----------------------------

For DFT calculations with pure exchange-correlation functionals (i.e., LDA and GGA), the default auxiliary basis, which is designed for fitting both the Coulomb and the Hartree-Fock exchange integrals, may be unnecessarily too large. We recommend using the ``weigend`` family :cite:`Weigend06PCCP` for a more cost-effective choice as shown in the following example::

    from pyscf import gto, dft
    mol = gto.M(atom='N 0 0 0; N 0 0 1.2', basis='def2-tzvpp')
    mf = dft.RKS(mol, xc="pbe").density_fit().run() # -109.432329411505
    print(mf.with_df.auxmol.basis)                  # default: def2-tzvpp-jkfit
    print(mf.with_df.auxmol.nao_nr())               # 154 aux basis functions
    mf.with_df.auxbasis = "weigend"
    mf.kernel()                                     # -109.432334646585
    print(mf.with_df.auxmol.nao_nr())               # 98 aux basis functions


.. _save_reuse_df_integrals:

Saving and reusing DF integrals
===============================

By default, the DF integrals are discarded after the calculations are done. Sometimes it is beneficial to save those integrals on disk and re-use them for later calculations. This can be done by specifying a HDF5 file where the DF integrals will be saved via setting :attr:`_cderi_to_save` either at the SCF stage::

    mf = scf.RHF(mol).density_fit()
    mf.with_df._cderi_to_save = 'saved_cderi.h5'
    mf.kernel()

or initializing a :class:`DF` object separately::

    mydf = df.DF(mol)
    mydf.auxbasis = df.make_auxbasis(mol)
    mydf._cderi_to_save = 'saved_cderi.h5'
    mydf.build()

The save integrals can be used later by setting :attr:`_cderi` to the HDF5 file holding the DF integrals::

    mf = scf.RHF(mol).density_fit()
    mf.with_df._cderi = 'saved_cderi.h5'
    mf.kernel()

More examples on saving and using DF integrals can be found in :source:`examples/df/10-access_df_integrals.py`, :source:`examples/df/11-access_df_tensor.py`, and :source:`examples/df/40-precompute_df_integrals.py`.
