# About PySCF 

PySCF is a free and open-source quantum chemistry code distributed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf) and released under the Apache-2.0
license.  The development of PySCF began in 2014. Since then, it has grown 
from being a single-group code to one relied on daily by over 100 research
teams in academia and industry across the world. For more details, see its
extensive list of [features](features.rst), [version history](version), and 
example [benchmark data](benchmark).

## Funding

The development of PySCF has been and continues to be generously supported by a
number of funding agencies. Most of the molecular quantum chemistry software
infrastructure was developed with support from the US National Science
Foundation, through grants CHE-1650436 and ACI-1657286. The periodic mean-field
infrastructure was developed with support from ACI-1657286. The excited-state
periodic coupled cluster methods were developed with support from the US
Department of Energy, Office of Science, through the grants DE-SC0010530 and
DE-SC0008624. Additional support for the extended-system methods has been
provided by the Simons Foundation through the Flatiron Institute, the Simons
Collaboration on the Many Electron Problem, a Simons Investigatorship in
Theoretical Physics, the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, and startup
funds from Princeton University and the California Institute of Technology.
