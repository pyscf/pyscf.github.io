# About PySCF 

PySCF is a free and open-source quantum chemistry code distributed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf) and released under the Apache-2.0
license.  The development of PySCF began in 2014. Since then, it has grown 
from being a single-group code to one relied on daily by over 100 research
teams in academia and industry across the world. For more details, see its
extensive list of [features](features.rst), [version history](version), and 
example [benchmark data](benchmark).

## Code of conduct

PySCF [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.rst):

In general, everyone interacting in PySCF projects is expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter what their position is within the project.

We are dedicated to making participation in the PySCF community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

## Funding

The development of PySCF has been and continues to be generously supported by a
number of funding agencies. Most of the molecular quantum chemistry software
infrastructure was developed with support from the US National Science
Foundation, through grants CHE-1650436 and ACI-1657286. The periodic mean-field
infrastructure was developed with support from ACI-1657286. The excited-state
periodic coupled cluster methods were developed with support from the US
Department of Energy, Office of Science, through the grants DE-SC0010530 and
DE-SC0008624. Additional support for the extended-system methods has been
provided by the Simons Foundation through the Flatiron Institute, the Simons
Collaboration on the Many Electron Problem, a Simons Investigatorship in
Theoretical Physics, the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, and startup
funds from Princeton University and the California Institute of Technology.
