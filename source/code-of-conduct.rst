# Code of Conduct

In general, everyone interacting in PySCF projects is expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter what their position is within the project.

We are dedicated to making participation in the PySCF community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.
