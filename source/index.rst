=================================

The Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework
PySCF is an open-source collection of electronic structure modules powered by Python. The package aims to provide a simple, lightweight, and efficient platform for quantum chemistry calculations and methodology development.


In addition to the core libraries, PySCF supports a rich
ecosystem of plugins and external modules that, for example, provide
MPI versions of some routines, additional quantum chemistry methods and analysis, interface with quantum computing toolkits *etc*.
