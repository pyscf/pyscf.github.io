<!--- 
The Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework (PySCF) is an open-source
collection of electronic structure modules powered by Python. The package
provides a simple, lightweight, and efficient platform for quantum chemistry
calculations and methodology development.
PySCF can be used to simulate the properties of molecules, crystals, and
custom Hamiltonians using mean-field and post-mean-field methods.
To ensure ease of extensibility, almost all of the features in PySCF are
implemented in Python, while computationally critical parts are
implemented and optimized in C. Using this combined Python/C
implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran
based quantum chemistry programs.
In addition to its core libraries, PySCF supports a rich
ecosystem of :ref:`installing_extproj`.
