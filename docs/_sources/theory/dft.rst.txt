Predefined XC functionals and functional aliases
================================================
There are a number of pure exchange-correlation functional and hybrid
functionals predefined in the package. Some functionals have aliased names. When
a functional names is assigned to the attribute :attr:`xc`, the DFT code will
look into the compound functional table (including hybrid functionals and
aliased pure functionals) and dispatch the functional to exchange and
correlation parts if the name was found in the table. E.g.  xc = 'pbe' leads to
the compound PBE functional which is equivalent to the assignment xc = 'pbe,pbe',
the PBE exchange plus PBE correlation. If the functional name was not found in
the compound functional table, the functional will be treated as exchange
functional. E.g. xc = 'b86' leads to B86 exchange only (without correlation).

Note that in the early PySCF DFT implementations (1.5.0 or earlier), the program
does not support functional alias. Both exchange and correlation have to be
explicitly assigned. xc = 'pbe' gives only the PBE exchange.

Customizing XC functionals
==========================
XC functionals of DFT methods can be customized. The simplest way to customize
the XC functional is to assigned a string expression to :attr:`mf.xc`::

    from pyscf import gto, dft
    mol = gto.M(atom='H  0  0  0; F  0.9  0  0', basis='6-31g')
    mf = dft.RKS(mol)
    mf.xc = 'HF*0.2 + .08*LDA + .72*B88, .81*LYP + .19*VWN'
    mf.kernel()
    mf.xc = 'HF*0.5 + .08*LDA + .42*B88, .81*LYP + .19*VWN'
    mf.kernel()
    mf.xc = 'HF*0.8 + .08*LDA + .12*B88, .81*LYP + .19*VWN'
    mf.kernel()
    mf.xc = 'HF'
    mf.kernel()

The XC functional string is parsed against the rules, as described below.

* The given functional description must be a one-line string.

* The functional description is case-insensitive.

* The functional description string has two parts, separated by ``,``.  The
  first part describes the exchange functional, the second part sets the
  correlation functional.

  - If "," not appeared in string, the entire string is treated as the name of a
    compound functional (containing both the exchange and the correlation
    functional) which was declared in the functional aliases list. See
    the list of predefined XC functionals in the section above.

    If the string was not found in the aliased functional list, it is treated as
    X functional.

  - To input only X functional (without C functional), leave the second part
    blank. E.g. description='slater,' means a functional with LDA contribution
    only.

  - To neglect the contribution of X functional (just apply C functional), leave
    blank in the first part, e.g. description=',vwn' means a functional with VWN
    only.

  - If compound XC functional is specified, no matter whether it is in the X
    part (the string in front of comma) or the C part (the string behind comma),
    both X and C functionals of the compound XC functional will be used.

* The functional name can be placed in arbitrary order.  Two names need to be
  separated by operators "+" or "-".  Blank spaces are ignored.  NOTE the parser
  only reads operators "+" "-" "*".  / is not supported.

* A functional name can have at most one factor.  If the factor is not given, it
  is set to 1.  Compound functional can be scaled as a unit. For example
  '0.5*b3lyp' is equivalent to 'HF*0.1 + .04*LDA + .36*B88, .405*LYP + .095*VWN'

* String "HF" stands for exact exchange (HF K matrix).  "HF" can be put in the
  correlation functional part (after comma). Putting "HF" in the correlation
  part is the same to putting "HF" in the exchange part.

* String "RSH" means range-separated operator. Its format is RSH(alpha; beta;
  omega).  Another way to input RSH is to use keywords SR_HF and LR_HF:
  "SR_HF(0.1) * alpha_plus_beta" and "LR_HF(0.1) * alpha" where the number in
  parenthesis is the value of omega.

* Be careful with the libxc convention of GGA functional, in which the LDA
  contribution is included.


There is another way to customize XC functionals which uses the :py:meth:`eval_xc`
method of the numerical integral class::

    mol = gto.M(atom='H 0 0 0; F 0.9 0 0', basis = '6-31g')
    mf = dft.RKS(mol)
    def eval_xc(xc_code, rho, spin=0, relativity=0, deriv=1, verbose=None):
        # A fictitious XC functional to demonstrate the usage
        rho0, dx, dy, dz = rho
        gamma = (dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)
        exc = .01 * rho0**2 + .02 * (gamma+.001)**.5
        vrho = .01 * 2 * rho0
        vgamma = .02 * .5 * (gamma+.001)**(-.5)
        vlapl = None
        vtau = None
        vxc = (vrho, vgamma, vlapl, vtau)
        fxc = None  # 2nd order functional derivative
        kxc = None  # 3rd order functional derivative
        return exc, vxc, fxc, kxc
    dft.libxc.define_xc_(mf._numint, eval_xc, xctype='GGA')
    mf.kernel()

By calling the :func:`dft.libxc.define_xc_` function, the customized :func:`eval_xc`
function is patched to the numerical integration class :attr:`mf._numint`
dynamically.
