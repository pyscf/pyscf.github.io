Theoretical methods
*******************

A variety of electronic structure methods are implemented in the PySCF package, 
including mean-field theories, many-body perturbation theories, and coupled-cluster theory, *etc*.
Many of them also support solid-state calculations with periodic boundary conditions considered. 
This chapter introduces the basic theories of these methods and some of their most common input parameters.
