## Funding
The development of PySCF has been and continues to be generously supported by a number of funding agencies. Most of the molecular quantum chemistry software infrastructure was developed with support from the US National Science Foundation, through grants CHE-1650436 and ACI-1657286. The periodic mean-field infrastructure was developed with support from ACI-1657286. The excited-state periodic coupled cluster methods were developed with support from the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, through the grants DE-SC0010530 and DE-SC0008624. Additional support for the extended-system methods has been provided by the Simons Foundation through the Simons Collaboration on the Many Electron Problem, a Simons Investigatorship in Theoretical Physics, the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, and startup funds from Princeton University and the California Institute of Technology.
